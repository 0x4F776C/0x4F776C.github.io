Hello and welcome!

I'm excited to launch my new portfolio and blog, hosted right here at [**0x4f776c.github.io**](https://0x4f776c.github.io)

**Purpose of This Site**

This site will serve as my personal space to document my journey and projects within the realm of **cybersecurity**. My primary focus areas include:

* Malware analysis and development deep-dives.
* Building and detailing cybersecurity lab environments.
* Creating and testing various security tools.
* Sharing insights on offensive security techniques and command & control (C2) infrastructure.

**What to Expect**

I plan to regularly post write-ups, tutorials, tool releases, and general thoughts related to these topics. Whether you're a fellow student, enthusiast, or professional in the field, I hope you find the content here valuable and interesting.

This platform is essentially a digital notebook and showcase for my work, including projects like [PowerSnail](https://github.com/0x4F776C/PowerSnail), [Windows-Malware-Dropper](https://github.com/0x4F776C/Windows-Malware-Dropper), and the [Threat Playground](https://github.com/0x4F776C/Threat-Playground).

Feel free to explore the existing posts and check back often for new updates. You can also connect with me via my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/0x4F776C).

Thanks for visiting!
